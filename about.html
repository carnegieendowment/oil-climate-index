                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The Oil-Climate Index (OCI) was developed to alert public and private stakeholders to the full array of oils’ climate impacts from various perspectives, with an eye toward informing investment, development, operations, and governance of the oil supply chain. The index provides new knowledge that these stakeholders can take into account to make more informed, strategic, and durable decisions throughout the oil sector. For instance, it can be used to analyze public policies to reduce oils’ greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.</p>
                <p>The OCI estimates and compares oils’ total life-cycle GHG emissions that stem from their upstream extraction, midstream refining, and downstream end use. Oils that are in production as well as prospective resources can be modeled using the OCI. The index offers the opportunity to manage the diversifying GHG footprints of disparate oils and to plan ahead to mitigate the climate impacts of tomorrow’s oils.</p>
                <p>Thirty oils have been modeled in Phase 1 of the index, the results of which are available in this web tool and in the report <a href="http://carnegieendowment.org/2015/03/11/know-your-oil-creating-global-oil-climate-index/i3oy" target="_blank"><em>Know Your Oil</em></a>. These resources represent 5 percent of global oil production as of mid-2015. In the next phase, the OCI will be expanded to include 50 global oils, encompassing a greater share of current oil production. As data allow, a goal is also to model oils that fall outside the GHG emission boundaries estimated in Phase 1 and to eventually run oils that are expected to be produced in the future through the OCI model to determine the extent of their GHG emissions. Updates to GHG emission estimates for those oils that have already been modeled will be tabulated and posted as new data are provided.</p>
                <p>Phase 1 of the Oil-Climate Index was developed with funding from the <a href="http://www.bluemoonfund.org/" target="_blank">blue moon fund</a>, the <a href="http://www.hewlett.org/" target="_blank">William and Flora Hewlett Foundation</a>, the <a href="http://www.oakfnd.org/" target="_blank">Oak Foundation</a>, the <a href="http://climateworks.org" target="_blank">ClimateWorks Foundation</a>, the <a href="http://www.rffund.org/" target="_blank">Rockefeller Family Fund</a>, and the <a href="http://carnegieendowment.org/specialprojects/OilClimateIndex/?lang=en" target="_blank">Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</a>.</p>

                <h2>About the OCI Models</h2>
                <p>Three GHG-emission-estimation models are aggregated to create the Oil-Climate Index. Model outputs are standardized by converting them into the same functional units, or metrics, so emission results can be summed. Phase 1 of the index estimates GHG emissions based on these functional units: per barrel of crude produced, according to the energy content of all final petroleum products (in megajoules), and per dollar value of all petroleum products sold.</p>

                <h3>The Models</h3>
                <p><strong>OPGEE</strong> (the Oil Production Greenhouse Gas Emissions Estimator) was developed by Adam Brandt and his colleagues at Stanford University, with significant assistance provided by James Duffy at the California Air Resources Board. OPGEE estimates upstream GHG emissions from oil resource extraction to transport to the refinery inlet. OPGEE version 1.1 draft D is used in the OCI web tool<!-- (see <a href="#figure1">figure 1</a>) -->.</p>
                <p>To download OPGEE and view the User Guide and Technical Documentation, visit: <a href="https://pangea.stanford.edu/researchgroups/eao/research/opgee-oil-production-greenhouse-gas-emissions-estimator" target="_blank">https://pangea.stanford.edu/researchgroups/eao/research/opgee-oil-production-greenhouse-gas-emissions-estimator</a>.</p>

                <p><strong>PRELIM</strong> (the Petroleum Refinery Life-Cycle Inventory Model) was developed by Joule Bergerson and her colleagues at the University of Calgary. Assistance was provided by Heather MacLean, researchers on the Life-Cycle Assessment of Oil Sands Technologies (LCAOST) project, Natural Resources Canada, Alberta Innovates, Energy and Environment Solutions, Carbon Management Canada, the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. PRELIM estimates midstream refining GHG emissions from the refinery inlet to the outlet, as well as refined petroleum product yields. PRELIM version 1.0 is used in the OCI web tool<!--  (see <a href="#figure2">figure 2</a>) -->.</p>
                <p>To download the PRELIM model and view the User Guide and Technical Documentation, visit: <a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/lcaost/PRELIM" target="_blank">http://www.ucalgary.ca/lcaost/PRELIM</a>.

                <p><strong>OPEM</strong> (the Oil Products Emissions Module) was developed by Deborah Gordon, Eugene Tan, and Jonathan Koomey. OPEM estimates downstream GHG emissions (from the refinery outlet) that result from the transport and end use of all oil products from a given crude. OPEM version 1.0 is used in the OCI web tool<!--  (see <a href="#figure3">figure 3</a>) -->.</p>
